This game is meant to help beginners to learn tips and tricks about photography. It is for simple and easy photography that still looks stunning. It is meant for people to be able to take photos with whatever type of camera they have (phone, tablet, or an old camera). Koko the Koala guides the player through several rounds of photos, all taken by me, to explain how to take good photos. At the end is the website I created in 7th Grade/Standard. And when the player goes back to the original game with Koko the Koala, then a game button will appear, and the player can play a game called Quest of the Champions, which what my teacher and I worked on in class. Quest of the Champions is a game where the player gets to choose between a bunny & and alien, but when they choose, the other character gets upset. The player has to dodge obstacles, and collect the candy. When the player reaches 20, then the game is over, and the player gets to choose between apologizing or not apologizing to the character that they didn't choose. This also serves as a funny lesson, where being rude isn't always the best option, and where being nice could possibly get you glory.
